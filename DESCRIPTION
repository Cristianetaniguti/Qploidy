Description: Provides functions for estimating ploidy and detecting aneuploidy in individuals using allele 
             intensities or counts data from high-throughput genotyping platforms, such as SNP arrays and 
             sequencing-based technologies. Includes tools for standardizing signal intensities, computing 
             B-allele frequencies (BAF) and z-scores, and identifying patterns of copy number variation.
