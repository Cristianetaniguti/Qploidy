This vignette describes how to use `Qploidy`, an R package designed for ploidy and aneuploidy estimation using genotyping platform data. For a detailed explanation of the `Qploidy` methodology, please refer to its [publication]().

### When does the `Qploidy` methodology work?

The `Qploidy` approach is effective under the following conditions:  
- Your marker data originates from **Axiom** or **Illumina genotyping arrays**.  
- Your marker data is derived from **targeted sequencing platforms** (e.g., DArTag, GTseq, AgriSeq).  
- All DNA samples were prepared following the **same library preparation protocol**.  
- You know the **ploidy** of at least a subset of 60 samples *or* you know the **most common ploidy** in the dataset.  
- Your dataset includes **heterozygous samples**.  

### When does the `Qploidy` methodology NOT work?

The methodology will not be effective under the following circumstances:  
- Your marker data comes from **RADseq** or **GBS** (Genotyping-by-Sequencing) platforms.  
- You intend to **combine datasets from different sequencing batches**.  
   - For example: If you extracted DNA and sequenced two plates (192 samples) as one batch, and later sequenced an additional three plates (288 samples) as a second batch, you would need to analyze the two batches **separately** in `Qploidy`. Combining all 480 samples into a single analysis will lead to incorrect results.  
- You **do not have a subset of samples with known ploidy** or **lack a predominant ploidy** in your dataset.  
- Your samples consist of **inbred lines** (homozygous individuals).

# Define Reference Samples - Choose Path (1) or (2)

`Qploidy` applies a standardization method to allele intensities or read counts to enable the comparison of copy numbers across the genome of a sample. To achieve this, it requires a set of reference samples. There are two ways to select these reference samples:

1. **If you have a subset of samples with known ploidy**, `Qploidy` will use this subset as the reference.  
2. **If you know the most common ploidy among your samples**, you can initially run `Qploidy` using all samples as the reference. From this first run, you can identify samples with the common ploidy, then select this subset to use as the reference in a second run of `Qploidy`.

Below are the steps to proceed for each case, tagged as (1) and (2):

## (1) Using a Subset with Known Ploidy

For this method, you will need to separate your subset of samples with known ploidy:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tetraploids_subset <- read.csv("tetraploids.csv")
data_reference <- data[which(data$SampleName %in% tetraploids_subset$x),]
```

## (2) Using the Most Common Ploidy

For this method, you will use the entire dataset as the reference during the first round of the `Qploidy` run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_reference <- data
```

# (1) and (2) Run Dosage Caller

To proceed, you need to determine the dosage for all reference samples. If you havenâ€™t done this yet, you can use any suitable dosage caller.  

- For **array data**, we recommend using the [`fitPoly`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitPoly/index.html) package.  
- For **sequencing data**, we suggest using the [`updog`](https://github.com/dcgerard/updog) or [`polyRAD`](https://github.com/lvclark/polyRAD) packages.  

These packages determine dosages by analyzing the distribution of allele intensities or read counts across all samples for each marker, using an informed ploidy model. You will provide either the **most common ploidy in your population** or the **known ploidy of your selected subset** as the informed ploidy.  

- **Path (2):** If you provide the most common ploidy, samples with different ploidy levels may receive incorrect dosages. However, these samples can be filtered out in the next step.  

**Warning:**  
Depending on the number of samples and markers, this step may take a significant amount of time to complete. It is highly recommended to run it on a high-performance computing system where you can utilize multiple cores and avoid issues with excessive RAM usage.

### Target sequencing VCF data

* If the VCF file already contains dosage/genotype information called considering the subset/most common ploidy:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
genos <- qploidy_read_vcf("my_file.vcf", geno = TRUE) # This is a example code, data not available
dim(genos)

genos.pos <- qploidy_read_vcf("my_file.vcf", geno.pos = TRUE) # This is a example code, data not available
head(genos.pos)
```
* If the VCF file does not have marker names in the `ID` column of the fixed portion, then you will see `NAs` in the `MarkerName` column. You can use the following code (concatenates the chromosme and position as a marker name) to fix this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
genos.pos$MarkerName=paste0(genos.pos$Chromosome,"_",genos.pos$Position)
head(genos.pos)
```
#### (1) Filter the genos object to keep only the known ploidy samples subset

```{r, eval=FALSE}
genos <- genos[which(genos$SampleName %in% tetraploids_subset),]
```

* If the VCF file doesn't contain dosage/genotype information called considering the subset/most common ploidy:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

See the details of the parameters with `?standardize`.

The `print` function of the resulting object provides information about marker filtering during the process. One critical filtering step involves the number of dosage clusters represented for each marker. If your samples are highly inbred at certain loci, you might not have individuals representing all possible dosages for those marker locations.  

For example, when using tetraploids as the reference, some markers may have individuals with dosages of only 0, 1, 3, and 4 (missing dosage 2). Without representatives for the missing dosage, `Qploidy` standardization cannot be performed.  

- If `threshold.n.clusters` is set to `ploidy + 1`, markers with missing dosages will be discarded.  
- If `threshold.n.clusters` is smaller than `ploidy + 1`, the missing dosage cluster centers will be imputed for standardization purposes.  

## Recover the `ploidy_standardization` Object from a Saved File

To revisit this step later without re-running the upstream functions, you can load the previously generated file using the `read_qploidy_standardization` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
roses_data_standardized <- read_qploidy_standardization("standardization_results/roses_texas_5clust.tsv.gz")
```

# (1) and (2) Plot results

`Qploidy` provides several options for visualization of the results. Check the complete description with `?plot_qploidy_standaridization`. Bellow you can see examples:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Select a sample to be evaluated
samples <- unique(roses_data_standardized$data$SampleName)
head(samples)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

It is important to note that the quality of results can vary across samples, as observed in different plots. Key aspects to assess include:  
- How sharp the peaks are in the histogram plots.  
- How well the dots cluster in the BAF vs. genomic position plots.  
- Whether the patterns match the decay or increase of the Z-score (Z).  

In our publication, we categorize sample quality into different **resolutions** based on the ability to estimate copy numbers, ranked from highest to lowest resolution:  
1. **Chromosome-arm resolution**: When the copy number of all chromosome arms can be estimated.  
2. **Chromosome resolution**: When at least one chromosome armâ€™s copy number cannot be estimated.  
3. **Sample resolution**: When the copy number of at least one entire chromosome cannot be estimated.  
4. **None**: When the histogram peaks, considering all markers, do not fit any of the expected ploidy levels tested.  

For more details and examples, please refer to the publication.

# (1) and (2) Ploidy Estimation for All Samples

Highly inbred samples cannot be evaluated for copy number using this method. As a result, `Qploidy` returns a missing value (`NA`) for these cases.

### Export ploidy result table

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(estimated_ploidies_format$ploidy, file = "ploidies_before_visual_evaluation.csv")

## (1) and (2) Save plots for all samples

Facilitate individual visual inspection by generating figures for all samples in a loop:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("figures")

for(i in 1:length(samples)){
  print(paste0("Part:",i,"/",length(samples)))
  print(paste("Generating figures for", samples[i],"..."))
  # This function will generate figures for sample, chromosome and chromosome-arm resolution level evaluation
  all_resolutions_plots(data_standardized = roses_data_standardized,
                        sample = samples[i], 
                        ploidy = estimated_ploidies_chromosome$ploidy[i,2:8], 
                        chr = 2:8,
                        centromeres = c("1" = 22000000, "2" = 36000000, "3" = 4000000, 
                                        "4" = 20000000, "5" = 52000000, "6" = 32000000, "7" = 20000000),
                        file_name = paste0("figures/",samples[i]))
  print(paste("Done!"))
}
```

By visualizing the plots, you can correct the results from `area_estimate_ploidy` and add resolution information for each sample. See the example below:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ploidy_corrected <- read.csv("ploidies_after_visual_inspection.csv")

```

# (2) Improve standardization selecting a known ploidy subset after first round

If you used the most common ploidy as the reference instead of a subset with known ploidy, the standardization may not be as accurate. You can improve the resolution by following these steps:  
i.   Select the highest resolution plots from the first standardization round.  
ii.  Filter these samples from the `data` object.  
iii. Run standardization again using this subset as the reference.  
iv.  Reevaluate the plots and estimate the ploidy once more.


```{r, eval=FALSE}

#i) Select the highest resolution plots from the first standardization round.
data_reference2 <- ploidy_corrected$ID_array[which(ploidy_corrected$ploidy == 4 & ploidy_corrected$Resolution == "chromosome-arm")]
length(data_reference2) # Total of 42 individuals, more is better

data_reference2 <- ploidy_corrected$ID_array[which(ploidy_corrected$ploidy == 4 & ploidy_corrected$Resolution == "chromosome")]
length(data_reference2) # With chromosome resolution we found 219, a better sample size

#ii) Filter these samples from the `data` object.  
genos_round2 <- genos[which(genos$SampleName %in% data_reference2),]

#iii) Run standardization again using this subset as the reference.  
roses_data_standardized_round2 <- standardize(data = data,
                                              genos = genos_round2,
                                              geno.pos = genos.pos,
