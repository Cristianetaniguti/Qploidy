The goal of Qploidy is to perform ploidy and aneuploid estimation using data from Axiom and Illumina array genotyping platforms. The package has a shiny interface to facilitate and provide graphics visualization of the two steps: i) Interpolation; ii) Ploidy estimation. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of Qploidy like so:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cristianetaniguti/Qploidy")
```

## How to use

You can use Qploidy using its graphical interface by:

``` r
library(Qploidy)
run_app()
```

Or you can also use its functions individually. Access furthers instructions for that in its tutorial:
