\arguments{
\item{data_standardized}{An object of class `qploidy_standardization` containing standardized data for ploidy analysis.}

\item{sample}{A character string specifying the sample name to be analyzed.}

\item{ploidy}{A numeric value indicating the expected ploidy of the sample. This parameter is required.}

\item{centromeres}{A named vector with centromere positions (in base pairs) for each chromosome. The names must match the chromosome IDs in the dataset. This is used for chromosome-arm level resolution.}

\item{types_chromosome}{A character vector defining the plot types for chromosome-level resolution. Options include:
- "het": Plots heterozygous locus counts.
- "BAF": Plots B-allele frequency (BAF).
- "zscore": Plots z-scores.
- "BAF_hist": Plots BAF histograms for each chromosome.
- "ratio": Plots raw ratios for each chromosome.
Default is c("Ratio_hist", "BAF_hist", "zscore").}

\item{types_chromosome_arm}{A character vector defining the plot types for chromosome-arm level resolution. Options include:
- "het": Plots heterozygous locus counts.
- "BAF": Plots B-allele frequency (BAF).
- "zscore": Plots z-scores.
- "BAF_hist": Plots BAF histograms for each chromosome arm.
- "ratio": Plots raw ratios for each chromosome arm.
Default is c("Ratio_hist", "BAF_hist", "zscore").}

\item{types_sample}{A character vector defining the plot types for sample-level resolution. Options include:
- "Ratio_hist_overall": Plots a histogram of raw ratios for the entire genome.
- "BAF_hist_overall": Plots a BAF histogram for the entire genome.
Default is c("Ratio_hist_overall", "BAF_hist_overall").}

\item{file_name}{A character string defining the output file path and name prefix for the saved plots. The function appends resolution-specific suffixes to this prefix. If NULL, plots are not saved to files.}

\item{chr}{A vector specifying the chromosomes to include in the analysis. If NULL, all chromosomes are included.}
}
\value{
A list containing the generated plots for each resolution:
- `chromosome`: Plot for chromosome-level resolution.
- `chromosome_arm`: Plot for chromosome-arm level resolution (if centromeres are provided).
- `sample`: Plot for sample-level resolution.
}
\description{
This function generates and saves plots for visual inspection of ploidy at different resolutions: chromosome, chromosome-arm, and sample levels. It is designed for parallelization purposes and supports customization of centromere positions and chromosome selection.
}
\details{
The function generates three types of plots:

- **Chromosome-level resolution**: Plots raw ratio, BAF histograms, z-scores, heterozygous locus counts, and BAF for each chromosome.
- **Chromosome-arm level resolution**: Similar to chromosome-level but splits data by chromosome arms using centromere positions.
- **Sample-level resolution**: Combines all markers in the sample to generate overall raw ratio and BAF histograms.

The plots are saved as PNG files with the following suffixes:
- `_res:chromosome.png`
- `_res:chromosome_arm.png`
- `_res:sample.png`

If `file_name` is NULL, the plots are not saved to files but are returned in the output list.
