\title{Plot graphics for ploidy visual inspection for each resolution}
\usage{
all_resolutions_plots(
  data_standardized,
  sample,
  ploidy,
  centromeres,
  file_name = NULL,
  chr = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_standardized}{An object of class `qploidy_standardization` containing standardized data for ploidy analysis.}

\item{sample}{A character string specifying the sample name to be analyzed.}

\item{ploidy}{A numeric value indicating the expected ploidy of the sample. This parameter is required.}

\item{centromeres}{A named vector with centromere positions (in base pairs) for each chromosome. The names must match the chromosome IDs in the dataset. This is used for chromosome-arm level resolution.}

\item{file_name}{A character string defining the output file path and name prefix for the saved plots. The function appends resolution-specific suffixes to this prefix.}

\item{chr}{A vector specifying the chromosomes to include in the analysis. If NULL, all chromosomes are included.}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It saves the generated plots as PNG files in the specified location.
}
\description{
This function generates and saves plots for visual inspection of ploidy at different resolutions: chromosome, chromosome-arm, and sample levels. It is designed for parallelization purposes and supports customization of centromere positions and chromosome selection.
}
\details{
The function generates three types of plots:

- **Chromosome-level resolution**: Plots raw ratio and BAF histograms for each chromosome.
- **Chromosome-arm level resolution**: Similar to chromosome-level but splits data by chromosome arms using centromere positions.
- **Sample-level resolution**: Combines all markers in the sample to generate overall raw ratio and BAF histograms.

The plots are saved as PNG files with the following suffixes:
- `_res:chromosome.png`
- `_res:chromosome_arm.png`
- `_res:sample.png`
}
