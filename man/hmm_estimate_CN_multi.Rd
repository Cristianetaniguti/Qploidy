\usage{
hmm_estimate_CN_multi(
  qploidy_standarize_result,
  sample_ids = "all",
  n_cores = 2,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{qploidy_standarize_result}{An object of class qploidy_standardization as returned by standardize().}

\item{sample_ids}{Character vector of sample IDs to analyze, or "all" for all samples in the data.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores to use (default: 2).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to hmm_estimate_CN (e.g., chr, snps_per_window, etc).}
}
\value{
A data.frame with results for all samples, as returned by hmm_estimate_CN$result, combined.
}
\description{
Runs copy-number HMM for each sample in a user-defined vector (or all samples if "all" is specified).
Returns a combined data.frame with results for all samples.
