\title{Merge CN summary with area-based ploidy estimates}
\usage{
merge_cn_summary_with_estimates(
  hmm_summarized,
  qploidy_area_ploidy_estimation,
  level = c("chromosome", "chromosome-arm", "sample")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hmm_summarized}{Data.frame from summarize_cn_mode.}

\item{qploidy_area_ploidy_estimation}{Object containing area-based ploidy matrices.}

\item{level}{Character. Merge level: 'chromosome', 'chromosome-arm', or 'sample'.}
}
\value{
Data.frame with merged columns: sample, chromosome, HMM CN mode, area-based CN, confidence metrics, and window count.
}
\description{
Merges summarized HMM CN results with area-based ploidy estimates for each sample and chromosome (or arm).
Useful for combining HMM and area-based results for reporting or downstream analysis.
