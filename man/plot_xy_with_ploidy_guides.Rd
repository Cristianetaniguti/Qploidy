\title{Plot X–Y scatter with ploidy dosage guide lines and optional sample highlighting}
\usage{
plot_xy_with_ploidy_guides(
  df,
  ploidy = 2,
  sample = "all",
  highlight_color = "tomato",
  other_color = "grey75"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A `data.frame` containing at least columns `X` and `Y`. If
`sample = "all"` or a specific sample is to be highlighted, `df` should also
contain a `SampleName` column.}

\item{ploidy}{Integer (≥ 2). Ploidy used to compute and draw dosage guide lines.}

\item{sample}{Character. Either `"all"` to color all samples by `SampleName`,
or the name of a single sample to highlight. Default: `"all"`.}

\item{highlight_color}{Color used for the highlighted sample when
`sample != "all"`. Default: `"tomato"`.}

\item{other_color}{Color used for non-highlighted samples when
`sample != "all"`. Default: `"grey75"`.}
}
\value{
A **ggplot** object.
}
\description{
Creates a dot plot of allele counts `X` (A-allele) vs `Y` (B-allele) and overlays
expected dosage guide lines for a given ploidy. You can either color all samples
(`sample = "all"`) or highlight a single sample while rendering the others in gray.
Samples that have no plotted points (e.g., due to non-finite `X`/`Y`) are
automatically omitted from the legend.
}
\details{
The function:
* Drops rows where `X` or `Y` are non-finite before plotting and builds the legend
  from the remaining points.
* When `sample = "all"`, colors points by `SampleName` (requires a `SampleName` column).
* When `sample` is a specific name, only that sample is colored with
  `highlight_color`; all others use `other_color`. If the requested sample has
  no plotted points, it is omitted from the legend.
* Draws dosage guide lines for dosages `d = 0, …, ploidy`:
  `d = 0` → horizontal line `Y = 0`; `d = ploidy` → vertical line `X = 0`;
  intermediate dosages are lines through the origin with slope
  \eqn{(d/ploidy) / (1 - d/ploidy)}.
* Uses a fixed aspect ratio (`coord_fixed`) so that one unit on the x- and y-axes
  has the same length.
