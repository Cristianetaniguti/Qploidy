\arguments{
\item{data}{A `data.frame` containing the full dataset with the following columns:
- MarkerName: Marker identifiers.
- SampleName: Sample identifiers.
- X: Reference allele intensity or count.
- Y: Alternative allele intensity or count.
- R: Total signal intensity or read depth (X + Y).
- ratio: Allelic ratio, typically Y / (X + Y).}

\item{genos}{A `data.frame` containing genotype dosage information for the reference panel.
- MarkerName: Marker identifiers.
- SampleName: Sample identifiers.
- geno: Estimated dosage (0, 1, 2, ...).
- prob: Genotype call probability (used for filtering low-confidence genotypes).}

\item{geno.pos}{A `data.frame` with marker position metadata.
- MarkerName: Marker identifiers.
- Chromosome: Chromosome names.
- Position: Base-pair positions on the genome.}

\item{threshold.missing.geno}{Numeric (0–1). Maximum fraction of missing genotype data allowed per marker.
Markers with a higher fraction will be removed.}

\item{threshold.geno.prob}{Numeric (0–1). Minimum genotype call probability threshold.
Genotypes with lower probability will be treated as missing.}

\item{ploidy.standardization}{Integer. The ploidy level of the reference panel used for standardization.}

\item{threshold.n.clusters}{Integer. Minimum number of expected dosage clusters per marker.
For diploid data, this is typically 3 (corresponding to genotypes 0, 1, and 2).}

\item{n.cores}{Integer. Number of cores to use in parallel computations (e.g., for cluster center estimation and BAF generation).}

\item{out_filename}{Optional. Path to save the final standardized dataset to disk as a CSV file (suitable for Qploidy).}

\item{type}{Character. Type of data used for clustering:
- "intensities": For array-based allele intensity data.
- "counts": For sequencing data.
- "updog": Automatically set when `multidog_obj` is provided.}

\item{multidog_obj}{Optional. An object of class `multidog` from the `updog` package, containing model fits and estimated biases.
If provided, this will override the `type` parameter and use `updog`'s expected cluster positions.}

\item{parallel.type}{Character. Parallel backend to use ("FORK" or "PSOCK"). "FORK" is faster but only works on Unix-like systems.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress and filtering information to the console.}

\item{rm_outlier}{Logical. If TRUE, uses Bonferroni-Holm corrected residuals to remove outliers before estimating cluster centers.}

\item{cluster_median}{Logical. If TRUE, uses the median of theta values to estimate cluster centers. If FALSE, uses the mean.}
}
\value{
An object of class "qploidy_standardization" (list) with the following components:
  - info: Named vector of standardization parameters.
  - filters: Named vector summarizing how many markers were removed at each filtering step.
  - data: A data.frame containing merged BAF, Z-score, and genotype information by marker and sample.
}
\description{
This function performs signal standardization of genotype data by aligning `theta` values
(allelic ratios or normalized intensities) to expected genotype clusters. It outputs
standardized BAF (B-allele frequency) and Z-scores per sample and marker.
}
\details{
Reference genotypes are used to estimate cluster centers either from dosage data
(e.g., via `fitpoly` or `updog`) or using an `updog` `multidog` object directly.
This function supports both array-based (intensity) and sequencing-based (count) data.

It applies marker and genotype-level quality filters, uses parallel computing
to estimate BAF, and generates a final annotated output suitable for CNV or
dosage variation analyses.

Filtering steps:
  1. Genotype probability filter: Genotypes with probability below `threshold.geno.prob` are set to missing.
  2. Marker missingness filter: Markers with fraction of missing genotypes above `threshold.missing.geno` are removed.
  3. Cluster number filter: Markers with fewer than `threshold.n.clusters` clusters are removed.
  4. Genomic info filter: Markers lacking chromosome or position info are removed.

Merging logic:
  - The function merges filtered genotype and signal data, estimates cluster centers, computes BAFs in parallel,
    and calculates Z-scores. Results are merged into a single output data.frame containing BAF, Z-score, and genotype info.
