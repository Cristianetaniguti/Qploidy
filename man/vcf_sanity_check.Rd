\title{Perform a Sanity Check on a VCF File}
\usage{
vcf_sanity_check(
  vcf_path,
  n_data_lines = 100,
  max_markers = 10000,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_path}{A character string specifying the path to the VCF file. The file can be plain text or gzipped.}

\item{n_data_lines}{An integer specifying the number of data lines to sample for detailed checks. Default is 100.}

\item{max_markers}{An integer specifying the maximum number of markers allowed in the VCF file. Default is 10,000.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print detailed messages during the checks. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A named logical vector indicating the results of various checks. Each element corresponds to a specific check, with TRUE indicating the check passed and FALSE indicating it failed.
}
\description{
This function performs a series of checks on a VCF file to ensure its validity and integrity. It verifies the presence of required headers, columns, and data fields, and checks for common issues such as missing or malformed data.
}
\details{
The function performs the following checks:
- **VCF_header**: Verifies the presence of the `##fileformat` header.
- **VCF_columns**: Ensures required columns (`#CHROM`, `POS`, `ID`, `REF`, `ALT`, `QUAL`, `FILTER`, `INFO`) are present.
- **max_markers**: Checks if the total number of markers exceeds the specified limit.
- **GT**: Verifies the presence of the `GT` (genotype) field in the FORMAT column.
- **allele_counts**: Checks for allele-level count fields (e.g., `AD`, `RA`, `AO`, `RO`).
- **samples**: Ensures sample/genotype columns are present.
- **chrom_info** and **pos_info**: Verifies the presence of `CHROM` and `POS` columns.
- **ref_alt**: Ensures `REF` and `ALT` fields contain valid nucleotide codes.
- **multiallelics**: Identifies multiallelic sites (ALT field with commas).
- **phased_GT**: Checks for phased genotypes (presence of `|` in the `GT` field).
